## Swanand Marathe
### Principal Investigator

Swanand did his MSc by research at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai. He studied the role of Norepinephrine receptors in modulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis and depressive-like behavior. He was particularly interested in fast-acting antidepressant treatments. Swanand did Ph.D. at the Department of Medicine, University of Fribourg, Switzerland. During his Ph.D., he chose to tread a slightly unconventional path, working on cell cycle regulation in post-mitotic neurons and by studying the role of astrocytes in modulating behavior. He later worked as a scientist at the Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Switzerland for two years, before starting his own lab at IISc. He is currently studying the role of astrocytes in mood-related behavior.

## Garima Virmani
### Graduate Student

Garima received both Bachelors and Masters degrees from University of Delhi with Zoology as major and Molecular endocrinology and Reproductive biology as the specialization. She joined the lab as the first PhD student in 2017. She has always found herself fascinated by functioning of the brain and related aspects. When she is free and her brain is not thinking about itself and of others, she likes to read about snakes and other cold blooded crawlers. Her work is primarily focused on the effects of monoamines on astrocytes and its implications in mood disorders.

## Parul Sethi
### Project Assistant

Parul did her B.tech from Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi with majors in Maths & Information Technology and minor in Biology. Her research interest involves exploring the systems and circuitry involved in brain plasticity and what goes wrong in case of neurological or psychiatric disorders. In Swanand lab, she is working on investigating the role of neuron-astrocytes interactions using computational models and also on improving the tools for morphological analysis of astrocytes. She is also a hobby artist and can be found doodling around in her free time.

## Arnab Nandi
### Graduate Student (In collaboration with Naren Ramanan's lab)

After receiving B.Sc. in Zoology from Burdwan University, Arnab pursued M.Sc. in Zoology from Banaras Hindu University with Molecular and Human genetics as his area of specialization. The 1.5Kg mass sitting on his shoulders has always made him wonder about its function. Role of neurons as a key player in modulating behavior is well appreciated, whereas other cell types haven't received much attention. Emerging pieces of evidence are making a strong case for their significant contributions to brain function and behavior. Arnab is exploring these by looking at the role of astrocytes in modulating stress resilience. To keep his own brain stress free, he listens to music or engages himself in stage performances like drama and mime, or drawing cartoons.

## Aatmika Barve
### Intern

I am a research intern, pursuing my dissertation at IISc for the completion of my Integrated BTech MTech Dual Degree in Cognitive Neuroscience and Biotechnology from Centre for Converging Technologies, University of Rajasthan. I was always held up by the molecular aspects of Neurobiology. I am interested to learn how various cognitive processes are easily maintained by the coordination of neurons and glia. My project allows me to look deeper into the neuropharmacological domains of subject. 
In my free time, I like to read books, write poems and make paintings.​

- Souvik Ghosh, IISER Kolkata, Summer Intern, Summer 2017
- Sanskruti Biswal, IISER Kolkata, Summer Intern, Summer 2018
- Srijani Biswas - Research Intern (January - July, 2018) - Currently PhD student at University of Texas, Southwestern
    - Srijani is a research intern pursuing her final semester thesis at IISc, as a part of her dual degree program in Biological Sciences and Mechanical Engineering from BITS Pilani, Goa campus. Her project involves automating the analysis of astrocyte morphology after stress and antidepressant treatments using MATLAB. This project is allowing her to work on something wherein she can combine her interests in neurobiology and engineering. In her free time, Srijani enjoy spending time with her family and friends, as well as reading, blogging and sleeping.
