### Role of Astrocytes in Behavior and Disease

Although how neurons influence behavior has been investigated in great detail,
there has been little clarity on the role played by astrocytes, a far more
abundant cell type, in orchestrating behavior. Astrocytes form an integral
part of the synaptic machinery and a single astrocyte can contact and
influence the function of about 1,00,000 synapses. They are highly important
for normal synaptic function and many brain disorders are associated with
astrocytic dysfunction. We are interested in studying how astrocytes and
neurons communicate with each other to modulate synaptic plasticity. We
investigate the role of astrocytes in behavior with a particular emphasis on
mood-related disorders such as anxiety and depression. We are currently
studying Jagged-Notch signaling at astrocyte-neuron interfaces.
